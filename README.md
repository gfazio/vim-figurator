Configuration files and personal vim setup

I've created this just so that I can play around with my vim setup as I change from old school vim set up, to using pathogen and bundles. As I play around with this I figured it would be good to be able to access/install this setup to wherever I need to as work situations change, so that it matches my personal laptop setup.
